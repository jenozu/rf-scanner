## 🔄 Updating Your Inventory Later

When you export new data from SAP:

1. **Export from SAP** using the same format:
   - Warehouse, BinCode, ItemCode, ItemName, QtyInBin

2. **Upload to App:**
   - Settings → Clear All Data
   - Upload new file
   - Continue working

3. **Or Keep Results:**
   - If you want to keep counting data, export first
   - Then clear and reload

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**"Error reading file"**
- Make sure it's the `.xlsx` file, not `.xls`
- Try re-saving from Excel

**"Missing columns"**
- Your file should work as-is!
- If you modified it, ensure: BinCode, ItemCode, ItemName, QtyInBin

**"Takes too long to load"**
- 7,054 items might take 2-3 seconds
- This is normal for large files

**"Some items missing"**
- Check if they have BinCode and ItemCode in SAP
- Empty bins (Qty=0) are still loaded

---

## 🎊 You're All Set!

Your `master_inventory.xlsx` file is **100% ready to use**.

Just upload it and start scanning! 📱

## 📝 Notes for SAP Integration

If you're using the Python script to generate this file from SAP:
- ✅ The output format is already compatible
- ✅ No need to rename columns
- ✅ Just export and upload directly

Current Python script creates:
```
Warehouse, BinCode, ItemCode, ItemName, QtyInBin
```

App now recognizes these natively!

**Next:** Upload your file and explore the features! 🚀
