### Daily Workflows:

#### **Receiving Workflow:**
1. Navigate to **Receive** tab
2. Select a purchase order
3. Click "Receive" on items
4. Enter received quantity
5. Select or create putaway location
6. Confirm putaway

#### **Picking Workflow:**
1. Navigate to **Pick** tab
2. Select a wave to start
3. Follow guided picking:
   - Scan or go to bin location
   - Pick the required quantity
   - Confirm pick
   - Move to next location
4. Complete wave

#### **Cycle Counting Workflow:**
1. Navigate to **Inventory** tab
2. Scan bin location OR select from task list
3. Review expected quantities
4. Enter actual physical count
5. Submit count (variance auto-calculated)

#### **Inquiry/Scanning:**
